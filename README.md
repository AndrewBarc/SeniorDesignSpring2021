Project Description:
The intention of this project is to design, implement, and demonstrate a Smart Music Reactive Lighting System that performs on par with some of the more sophisticated commercial products. While the design space is open to the studentâ€™s creativity and engineering skills, it is envisioned that the system would intelligently combine analog and digital circuits and systems to achieve stunning results.  Furthermore, it is desired that various parameters and operational modes, such as color schemes, animation rates, and timing parameters will be managed by a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet.
